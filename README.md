here I configured relations properly so that I can create specialist with

set of clients and the same for clients. However, there are some things needs to be done such as:

1) ConcurrentModificationException
2) adding new client for specialist
3) adding new specialist for clients
4) patch method to change info for all entities
5) configure many-to-one relation between specialist and rehub
6) complete all crud methods
