Hello, this is a application for people who want to find rehabilitation specialist. 

Here you can choose one with search feature, explore
about chosen specialist information and his rehabilitation center.
Once you have chosen, you have opportunity to have chat as before your rehabilitation started

To run this application, firstly you need to run docker compose and to start all depended dbs and
then you should run spring boot app with idea or mvn cmd. 

Actually I wanted it all to be started at once in docker compose. 
But I didn't manage and tried many times to deal with it. Hope I figure out how to handle it later or somebody will help me.
